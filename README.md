# Network Monitoring Tool using Go

## What We Need

1.  **Monitor Network Health**:
    
    *   **Performance Metrics**: Measure things like network speed (latency, bandwidth) and errors (packet loss, connectivity issues).
    *   **Health Status**: Determine if the network is up or down and if devices are functioning properly.
2.  **Visualize Data**:
    
    *   **Graphs and Charts**: Use visual tools to make data easy to understand. This helps quickly identify issues and trends.
    *   **Real-time Updates**: Ensure the data displayed is current and updates as new data comes in.
3.  **Send Alerts**:
    
    *   **Notification System**: Send alerts via email or SMS when something unusual is detected, like a drop in network speed or an outage.




## Overall Structure

1.  **Backend Service**:
    
    *   **Data Collectors**:
        *   Small programs written in Go that run on network devices to gather data.
        *   Example: Collecting data on bandwidth usage, latency, and errors.
    *   **Central Server**:
        *   A main server that receives data from data collectors.
        *   Processes the data and stores it in a database.
    *   **API**:
        *   Endpoints that the frontend can use.
    
2.  **Database**:
    
    *   Use InfluxDB to store time-series data like network performance metrics over time.
    *   Example: Storing data points such as "timestamp, device, latency, bandwidth".
      
3.  **Frontend**:
    *   Angular & D3.js to create interactive UI and real-time graphs and charts.
      
4.  **Messaging System**:
    *   Apache Kafka to handle the flow of data from the collectors to the central server.
